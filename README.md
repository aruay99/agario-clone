# agario-clone
This is a clone of Agar.io, implemented in Javascript mostly using the P5 library.
The goal of this clone is to create a simple framework on which you can implement new features and learn creating io games.
Inside `settings.json` you will find some settings that you can tweak to get inspired by different modifications, and have fun.
