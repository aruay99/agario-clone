## 🛠️ Setup

### Step 0. Prerequisites
- [Node.js v17.4.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v17.4.0/) - the version which this project was created and tested on.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - for cloning this repository. Alternatively, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), or [Download ZIP](https://github.com/starship/starship/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).

### Step 1. Download

```
git clone https://github.com/yamyam263/agario-clone.git
```

(Or use one of the other ways described in step 0 to download this repository to your system.)

### Step 2. Install

```
npm install
```

### Step 3. Run

```
npm start
```

✔️ You're done! Head over to `localhost:3000` on your browser to play the game!

## ⚙️ Configuration

The goal of this clone is to create a simple framework on which you can implement new features and learn how to create [io games](https://www.addictinggames.com/what-are-io-games).
Inside `settings.json` you will find some settings that you can tweak to get inspired by different modifications, and have fun.
* Head over to `settings.json` using your favorite editor (mine is [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - but even Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac would work). Start tweaking! Upon finishing step 3 of the setup, your terminal should be listening to any changes you make. Just hit save and test your changes on `localhost:3000` - there is no need to refresh.
